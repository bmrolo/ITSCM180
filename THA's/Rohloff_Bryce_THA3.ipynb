    "**Crowdsourcing** involves obtaining work, information, or opinions from a large group of people who submit their data via the Internet, social media, and smartphone apps. Wikipedia, the largest online encyclopedia, is known as the father of crowdsourcing which uses people’s knowledge all around the world to extend its database. In the following exercise we are going to use Python to mimic the crowdsourcing process used by Wikipedia:\n",
